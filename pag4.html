  <center><h1>Broly</h1></center>
  <h2>Base Transform</h2>
  <p>Uniquely to him, this transformation is also known as Super Saiyan Full Power (超サイヤ人フルパワー, Chō Saiya-jin Furu Pawā). When transformed into this state, Broly's body increases dramatically<br>
     in mass and he loses both the pupils in his eyes and his battle jacket. His hair and aura also take on a green tint.Power scaling is the cause of constant debates among Dragon Ball fans, and everyone's rankings<br>
    fall into disarray whenever a new transformation of power is unveiled. Dragon Ball Super's Broly is so powerful that he's born with a Power Level of 10,000, and he actually grows stronger the more he battles</p>

  <h2>super saiyan 1</h2>
  <p>Broly tanked Gohan and Trunks ki blast combined without even taking slight damage. Not to mention doesn't even charge up until the end of the movie. There's no realistic reason to think he's not, considering where<br>
    he is placed in the timeline, and the amount of power he has over everyone else without even charging up.Their battle is interrupted by the arrival of Broly in his strongest form ever, God Broly. Goku and Vegeta <br>
    immediately go Super Saiyan Blue but, just like in the movie Dragon Ball Super: Broly, these forms aren't enough to even faze the Legendary Super Saiyan, causing Goku to ask Shenron for aid.</p>

    <h2>Legendary Siyan</h2>
    <p>The Legendary Saiyan transformation is a form equivalent to the traditional Super Saiyan transformation in that it is the first in its own line of Saiyan transformations and is achieved via the same means: extreme anger, <br>
    self-loathing triggers the transformation once a Saiyan has broken the limits of their species.The Super Saiyan of the legend is the Original Super Saiyan that appeared on the original Saiyan homeworld a thousand years prior.<br>
    The Legendary Super Saiyan is Broly, that had a genetic mutation that made him too powerful. Bardock is a Super Saiyan only in the Dragon Ball Heroes special for the game.</p>
