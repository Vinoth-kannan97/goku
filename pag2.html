    <h2>Super Saiyan 1</h2>
  <p>Dragon Ball Z Episode 129, "Upgrade to Super Saiyan," he claimed it had to do with motivation. Once he got frustrated enough with his training, something in him snapped.<br>
     Surpassing Kakarot, becoming a Super Saiyan, and living or dying all stopped mattering. In that instant, he became a Super Saiyan.</p>

  <h2>Super Saiyan 2</h2>
  <p>Vegeta initially turned into a Super Saiyan 2 during the Majin Buu Saga. During his battle with Majin Buu, Vegeta pushed himself above his breaking point in order to acquire this form.
     Vegeta is probably capable of achieving the Super Saiyan 3 transformation, he never uses it in official Dragon Ball canon. Super Saiyan 3 has significant drawbacks,<br>
     such as draining the Saiyan's energy rapidly, and Vegeta may have observed these flaws and chosen to avoid using the form.</p>

    <h2>Super Saiyan God</h2>
    <p>During the final fight against Goku Black and Future Zamasu, Vegeta was able to attain the form and access it at will much like Goku. The two Saiyans also reveal that in addition to mastering this form,<br>
       it is also able to overcome the stamina issue associated with Super Saiyan Blue.</p>

    <h2>Super Saiyan Blue</h2>
    <p>In the manga, through frustration at Goku having surpassed him once more by tapping into Ultra Instinct, Vegeta overcame his limits and achieved this form - his uniquely styled mastery of Super Saiyan Blue.
        Super Saiyan Blue Evolved Vegeta is stronger than Goku's full power as it was before the tournament, since Vegeta had the power to bring down Top (even after his transformation into a God of Destruction).</p>

    <h2>Super Saiyan Blue Evolved</h2>
    <p>Unlike some transformations in Dragon Ball, Super Saiyan Blue Evolution first appears in the anime. In the episode of Dragon Ball Super called "Body, Soul and Power Unleashed! Goku and Vegeta!", <br>
    Vegeta breaks his own limits when he remembers his promise to Cabba.The Super Saiyan Blue Evolved transformation is the result of a Super Saiyan Blue who has broken their own limits. Vegeta achieved this state <br>
    in the Tournament of Power, during his battle with Jiren. It was unlocked when Vegeta remembered Cabba, and his strong desire to keep his promise to the young Saiyan.</p>

    <h2>Ultra Ego</h2>
    <p>Super Saiyan Blue Evolved Vegeta is stronger than Goku's full power as it was before the tournament, since Vegeta had the power to bring down Top (even after his transformation into a God of Destruction).
    When Ultra Ego is in use, the user becomes exponentially more powerful than before. Vegeta names the technique Ultra Ego in contrast to Ultra Instinct, which draws upon the principles of conquering oneself<br>
     while Ultra Ego seems to draw upon a severe level of self-indulgence in battle. </p>
