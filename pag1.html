    <h2>super saiyan 3</h2>
    <p>According to Goku, Super Saiyan 3 should really only be used in the Other World, or anywhere time doesn't flow. When used on Earth too much energy gets used up too quickly
    Sūpā Saiya-jin Surī, lit. "An Astounding, Great Transformation!! Super Saiyan 3", The fourteenth episode of the Majin Buu Saga and the two hundred forty-fifth overall<br>

    <h2>super saiyan God</h2>
    <p>To fight the enraged Future Zamasu, Goku becomes a Super Saiyan God, noting that after using the Evil Containment Wave, he doesn't have enough stamina to endure his <br>
       but he should be more than powerful enough to defeat the corrupt god.</p>

    <h2>super saiyan Blue</h2>
    <p>During his training with Whis on Beerus' planet, he figured out that after he made the Super Saiyan God power his base form, he could easily tap into his god ki whenever he wanted,<br>
       and then go super saiyan on top of that, thus transforming him into a Super Saiyan Blue.</p>

    <h2>super saiyan Blue with kaio_ken</h2>
    <p>Thus, Goku must maintain an extraordinary amount of focus when activating the technique in order to ensure its success. Since Super Saiyan Blue has perfect innate ki control, Goku is able to utilize<br>
       the power of the Kaio-ken in a similar manner to the way in which he can control it in his base form.</p>

    <h2>Ultra Instic</h2>
    <p>The strongest warriors from eight out of the twelve Universes are participating, and any team who loses in this tournament will have their universe erased from existence.
      It is unknown whether Universes 13 through 18 were brought back into existence due to Android 17's wish, as he asked the Super Shenron to restore all erased universes <br>
     and not specifically those erased in the Tournament of Power.</p>
